FAKE NEWS DETECTION


Fake news or pseudo-news is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media. 
The news is often reverberated as misinformation in social media but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well. 
This is a flask application that detects and identifies the fake or real news. The flask framework provides a robust and agile development environment and this application is based on the same. 
The `train_model_fakenews.py` can be used to tweak this model for further usage. The `news.csv` file contains the dataset used for the model's training.
